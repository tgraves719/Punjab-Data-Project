# Punjab Data Project

**A computational sociological analysis of British Punjab through the imperial print register, 1867–1942.**
Thomas Graves, with Prof. Emmett Davis.

## The live explorer

**→ [https://tgraves719.github.io/Punjab-Data-Project/](https://tgraves719.github.io/Punjab-Data-Project/)** *(GitHub Pages, served from `docs/`)*

An interactive explorer of three complete years, **1910–1912**: all twelve quarterly
*Catalogues of Books registered in the Punjab* under Act XXV of 1867 and Act X of 1890 —
**4,502 entries, 6,944,051 registered copies**, 350 printers, 1,726 publishers, 59 printing
cities (India Office Records SV 412/44, Punjab, Vol 13). Filterable entry table,
printer–publisher network, script-market analysis, curated exhibits, and a built-in scan
viewer that opens every record's source page image.

## What this repo contains

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | The published site: the self-contained explorer (`index.html`) plus the rendered page scans (`pages/<quarter>/`) it links to |
| `pipeline/` | Extraction pipeline: `render.py` → per-page extraction JSONs → `extract_api.py` (Batch API) → `postprocess.py` (normalization, SQLite) → `validate.py` (sequence checks, adjudication queues); `schema.md`, `aliases.json`, per-quarter manifests |
| `pipeline/constraints.py` | Independent quality check built on the register's own grammar and entity vocabulary; ranks the adjudication queue (D-018) |
| `pipeline/localize.py`, `lines.py`, `crops.py` | Native-script title localization: finds the vernacular title within each entry and pairs it with its printed romanization |
| `pipeline/data/<quarter>/extractions/` | The verbatim record layer: one JSON per catalog page, the catalog's own words preserved (misprints, editorializing and all) |
| `pipeline/data/<quarter>/out/` | Derived open data: `entries.csv`, `adjudication_queue.csv`, `validation_report.md` |
| `pipeline/data/<quarter>/marginalia_*.md` | Documentation of the handwritten verso indexes found in the bound volumes |
| `analysis/slice_1910/` | Analysis over the corpus: `build_network.py`, `script_market.py`, `build_site.py` (regenerates `docs/index.html`) |
| `analysis/ocr_lab/` | The native-script workstream: legibility measurements (`E0B_RESULTS.md`), localization results, and `REIMAGING_PILOT.md` — the 21-page experiment that decides whether re-imaging the volumes is worth buying |
| `analysis/integrity/` | Sweeps testing whether the stored record matches its own specification (`INTEGRITY_SWEEP.md`) |
| `dialectic/` | The method dialogue behind the August decisions. `dead_ends.md` first |
| `OCR_RESEARCH_AGENDA.md` | Governing document for transcription and extraction |
| `PLAN.md` / `DECISIONS.md` | Plan of record and the numbered decision log (D-001…) governing every normalization fold and method choice |

## Method in one paragraph

Three layers, kept separate: **page image → verbatim record → normalized layer.**
Every entry carries full provenance (printed page + PDF page); the catalog's wording is not
silently corrected — uncertain readings are flagged into per-quarter adjudication queues with
stated reasoning. Registration numbers run as one annual sequence and serial numbers chain
across quarters within each language–topic section; both are used as validation instruments.
The verbatim layer has been swept against the extractor's own flags and holds with five
identified exceptions (`analysis/integrity/INTEGRITY_SWEEP.md`).

## Two things to know before querying the data

- **`copies` is a TEXT column and 12.7% of its values carry a thousands separator.**
  `sum(cast(copies as integer))` silently undercounts by 16.7%. Use
  `sum(cast(replace(copies, ',', '') as integer))`. See `analysis/integrity/INTEGRITY_SWEEP.md`.
- **The register's own completeness is stratified by language.** `method` is blank for 3.3%
  of Urdu entries but 71.5% of Punjabi and 88.2% of Hindi; `char` is annotated for 28.9% of
  Punjabi entries against 0.7% of Urdu. Cross-language comparison on sparse fields needs a
  recorded-versus-blank control. This is a property of the imperial record, not of the
  extraction. See `analysis/ocr_lab/E0B_RESULTS.md` §3.

## What is deliberately not here

- The bound-volume scans (~25 GB of India Office PDFs) — only the per-page renders needed by
  the explorer are published, under `docs/pages/`.
- The SQLite database (`punjab.db`) — regenerable, see below.
- Private working material (interpretive memos, correspondence, collaborator transcription
  files).

## Rebuilding the site

```
cd pipeline
python postprocess.py manifest_1910Q1.json   # repeat for all twelve quarters: rebuilds punjab.db
cd ../analysis/slice_1910
python build_network.py && python script_market.py
python build_site.py --public                # web build: no local-path PDF links
cp out/explore_1910_1912.html ../../docs/index.html
python build_site.py                         # local build (with PDF deep-links)
```

## Licence and citation

Three licences, because this repository holds three different kinds of thing: **code** is
GPL-3.0-or-later, **data** is CC0 (it is a transcription of a public-domain government
record, and mostly not ours to license), and **prose** is CC BY 4.0. Full statement and
reasoning in [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md); machine-readable citation in `CITATION.cff`.

Citation is requested, not required. If you use the data, please cite the source record
too — and tell us what you find wrong in it.
